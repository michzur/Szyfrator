# Szyfrator
Szyfrator is a group project ( I'm responsible for code except Vigenere Cipher ), the purpose of which is to encrypt the text with traditional cartographic methods. I presented this program at "Ogólnopolska Konferencja Interdyscyplinarna „Współczesne Zastosowania Informatyki 2021”".

Run program through class App!

Choose a desired cipher and write a message, every cipher operate also in polish letters, and choose cipher/decipher.
Upper text window is input text, bottom is output, after cipher/decipher you can save bottom text or load saved text to upper text area.
To use "Podstawieniowy" Cipher you should insert your own symbols of given symbols length ( not smaller then 2), if a given letter is
smaller than desired length, we use "0" to align it, if letter is larger we use default.
